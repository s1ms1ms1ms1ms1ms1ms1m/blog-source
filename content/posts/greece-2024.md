During my recent trip to Greece, there were several moments that stood out to me.

## Corinth

Corinth was the last town that I visited during my trip. Visiting ancient Corinth was interesting since I was actually able to walk through the streets of the ancient city. I realized that these were the same streets walked by St. Paul.

>*For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison*, 2 Corinthians 4:17

Pursuing truth and what you believe is always worth it.

The bay near Corinth was beautiful during an approaching storm. A moment of reflection.

## Delphi

Delphi is a nice mountain town. I was there on Easter Sunday[^1] and saw the Greeks dancing and celebrating[^2]. 

[^1]: We were leaving Athens on Good Friday and got the wrong fare type to take the train to the airport. When we got there, a fare inspector caught us, asked "why guys?" with immense disappoinment. I explained that it was an honest mistake. He says "Usually, it's a 34 euro fine, but today in Greece we have a holy day. In honor of Easter, you can go through" LOL

[^2]: Christianity is alive in Greece. They also love the Byzantines.

One of the coolest moments was seeing the spring rain fall between the mountains. This was after deciding to drive in some general direction into the mountains for 30-40 minutes.

## Patras

## The Death of Admiral Nelson

While returning, we stopped in London UK for a few days. I realized how strong the mental of Admiral Horatio Nelson was in the maritime museum. Nelson was wounded in the battle of Trafalgar, and taken below deck. As he was dying, the battle went on, and he could hear the crew cheering with each surrendering french ship. When the battle was won, someone told him the  news, and he said "**Thank God, I have done my duty.**" shortly before his death.

After this, Britannia literally ruled the waves. A momentary affliction. 

## Post Scriptum

Several blog posts that I need to make:

- "stop telling me to stay safe"
- reflections on university
- something to do with philosophy of mind and categorizing the things i have read
	- currently reading basic writings of Carl Jung
	- views on philosophy of mind that i want to fully draw out. 
	- i believe in some parts of emergentism, monism
	- materialism is for redditors, 
	- the religious interpretation of psychological events is literally correct
