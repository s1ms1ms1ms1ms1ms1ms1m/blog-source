## Summary

In this blog post, I will outline my views on epistemic idealism and materialism. I argue that in Western culture, there has been a distinct cultural shift from idealist to materlialist thinking, and that this trend is clearly represented in various types of speech in English. I argue that this has lead to the death of religion, and generally, the lack of understanding of past texts and inner reasoning by modern people. 

Idealism is literally correct and materialist thinking leads to an autistic ignoration of the inner self.

**Disclaimer:** I am not a philosopher. I am very interested in learning more about this topic, and especially relations to theology. If you completely disagree, or if I am saying something stupid, please argue with me (email me brah).

## Definitions

Modern people turn to scientific explanations for all events. If an event can be perceived scientifically, that is, if it fits within the material worldview, then it is understood. Since people are composed of material components, people too can be understood through a material worldview. In particular, actions and perceptions are manifestations of some material process, and should therefore be understood as such. The materialist therefore jumps to the following point: *understanding of reality can be attained through an exclusively material understanding of the world*. That is, by total explanation of physical processes, we understand reality. This general viewpoint, and many perspectives associated with it, I will define to be **materialism**.

**Idealism** generally says that reality can only be known through "ideas and mental structures". The material world is reflected with mental *categories* and *representations* in the mind. To understand the structure of the world, we must understand the interactions between mental (ideal) categories that represent these objects.


## The Opener

There is a disrespect or ignoration of religion in the modern, Western, culture. While there exist "spiritually inclined" types who are spiritual and use Eastern symbolism, there is no real structured religious understanding or thinking in our culture, as it relates to daily life [^1]. One point that this vacuum is attributed to are the historical actions of the church, which I agree with, since the actions of the church as an institution have historically not represented the beliefs of Christians [^2]. People view religion as an instrument of the institution, and refuse to be "subject to an agenda" [^3] that the institution wants you to believe. The point that I severely disagree is that of scientific progress superceding the need for religious thinking. 

Science and religion are fundamentally different [^4], yet they are not dialectically opposed, like suggested by some. That is, one can believe in scientific expalantions without needing to refute religion. Science is focused on that which is material, ie. things in the physical world, objects  that experiments can be done on. Whatever your exact definition of science [^5], my main point is that it is focused on observations of material processess. What exactly is religion?

## What if you lived 3000 years ago?

Religious texts are strange to the modern person. If a moderner were to sit down and try to read a religous text for the first time, they would find the language esoteric, and the cultural references as strange. [Luke Smith argues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3s47-p9rE0) that the "mindset" of religious text is fundamentally different from the modern use of language. There are aspects of modern life where different language is required; day-to-day conversations, technical conversations, metaphorical speech. The way in which I describe how to make a cup of coffee differs from technical descriptions of things to do at work. Technical descriptions may use more Latin-derived words that have specific connotations, whereas daily speech is less specific, and using a technical term would sound very strange/robotic. The connotations of particular words totally influence the thing that we are trying to describe (see [uncleftish beholdings](https://msburkeenglish.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/uncleftish-beholding-aka-atomic-theory.pdf) (atomic theory), a text about atomic theory written with Latin-derived replaced using Germanic words in English). The point is that in English, the distinction between day-to-day things, metaphor, and more abstract/technical language exists. In ancient times, this distinction did not exist, and the mindset of technical reasoning was likely very different. 

Instead of asking "Did the Greeks believe in their gods?" you should ask "what were the Greeks referencing with their gods?". Material objects have essences, mental representations of their characteristics that transcend the object itself. For example, apples are red. The category of "redness" is a mental object that is not bound to the particular physical apple. Each thing is a combination of perfected (I will call) categories; abstracted essences of objects that your mind operates with [^6]. Many things are this way, and there are many driving forces in the material world that you drive your life. There may be rain tomorrow, or it may storm for a week, or it may be beautiful and sunny; either one of these would create a change. The ocean can provide food and transport, or it can be tormenting and punishing. Each depends on something beyond your control and is a fundamental force in the life of an ancient person. The forces themselves have a particular essence, and if an essence is personified, we arrive at a **god**. The Greek gods were personifications of essences that drove daily life [^7]. The interactions between Greek gods therefore describe an interaction between fundamental forces of life. When the Greeks told their myths, they were describing complicated processes that occur in the world, personified as interactions between gods. In their view, they were giving a "scientific" description of the world, since they were explaining the physical: it was a projection of the mental onto the material. The distinction I just described likely needed to be made very recently. In antiquity, the objects and the essence of the object were essentially viewed as the same. 

This mindset IS idealism. To understand the objects existing in the world, and since the physical object and its higher essence are identified, the nature of a physical object can ENTIRELY be understood through its mental representations, no further physical tests are required. I guess this was the issue.

## An argument for idealism








[^1]: Maybe I am in a very liberal city. In very conservative places in the West, I think religious understanding is completely misguided for a different reason. I'm leading to this. HYold on

[^2]: *Matthew 18:20*: For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.

[^3]:  I do not want to talk about this point further because it's an annoying one, but you can imagine my answer and it would be sentence of completely obvious text. just read it yourself bro

[^4]: Famous livestream sobber Jordan Peterson puts it as "science deals with facts, and religion deals with values". What Jordbong Weedersmoke does not realise is that science deals with **material** fact, and religion deals with facts consistent with an ideal/mental/moral set of values. more on this in a second hold on

[^5]: go debate this boring shit in a philosophy of science course who cares anyways

[^6]: Probably related to Plato's theory of forms

[^7]: maybe this is totally obvious
